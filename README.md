# StandupAlarm
StandupAlarm app helps people to be healthy.
I am updating the App.
It lets people exercise periodically e.g every 15 minutes.
There are two ways for alarm, one weekly and other hourly.
If user is notified an alert he can exercise according to 
predefined exercise video.
In the way the app lets people exercise.
